# JDBC-Database-Management-Systems 🌐

## What is JDBC-Database-Management-Systems?

The `jdbc-database-management-system` is a collection of projects demonstrating **JDBC operations** in Java. These projects showcase various methods of interacting with databases, focusing on secure, efficient, and scalable database management. The system utilizes **JDBC Statements**—`Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`—to perform **CRUD operations**.

## Architecture 🏗️

This repository follows a modular structure, where each subproject is dedicated to a specific JDBC interface and real-world use case.

### Student Management System (JDBC Statement)
- **Interface Used:** `Statement`
- **Description:** Executes static SQL queries for basic student data operations.
- **CRUD Example Project:** 👉 [View Project Example Link](https://github.com/thevishalchothe/jdbc-database-management-system/tree/929c478edff9e4fddd61004c4c19ab31290dd488/student-management-system-jdbc-statement-interface)

---

### Book Management System (JDBC PreparedStatement)
- **Interface Used:** `PreparedStatement`
- **Description:** Uses parameterized queries to safely manage book records and prevent SQL injection.
- **CRUD Example Project:** 👉 [View Project Example Link](https://github.com/thevishalchothe/jdbc-database-management-system/tree/929c478edff9e4fddd61004c4c19ab31290dd488/book-management-system-jdbc-preparedstatement)

---

### Product Management System (JDBC CallableStatement)
- **Interface Used:** `CallableStatement`
- **Description:** Calls stored procedures to manage product data and encapsulate complex SQL logic.
- **CRUD Example Project:** 👉 [View Project Example Link](https://github.com/thevishalchothe/jdbc-database-management-system/tree/929c478edff9e4fddd61004c4c19ab31290dd488/product-management-system-jdbc-callablestatement)

## **How It Works 🛠️**

1. **Student Management** utilizes the `Statement` interface to execute SQL queries for basic CRUD operations like adding, updating, and retrieving student data.
2. **Book Management** leverages the `PreparedStatement` interface for secure, parameterized SQL queries to handle book details and queries.
3. **Product Management** takes advantage of `CallableStatement` to interact with stored procedures, allowing for more complex operations and optimizations on the database side.
